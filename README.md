 # GUI-Display
  You Can see a running visual display of this code  here :- <br />
 https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/string-algorithm/manachars-algorithm/practice-problems/multiplayer/tic-tac-toe/
 
  If you Run this code run there it will use code as first player<br />
  But If you want to see its performance as second player<br />
  than use it against aadish goel(My bot)<br />
  I have uploaded the same code there with this name.<br />
  
 # Upto Here it is in C
 with the name of bot_tictactoe.c
   ## File used on Hacker Earth
 was with the name of bot_reversetictactoe.c<br />
 with a slight modification of taking transverse of input matrix
    
 # Now Python 3 in Action
 In application.py<br />
 There is a interface in which You can play with that bot<br />
 It uses the program exe file i.e bot_tictactoe.exe<br />
    
 # And For Running by One Click CMD bash
 write this in notepad
 
    echo off
    color a 
    cls
    python application.py
    pause
    
 and save as .bat file <br />
 for eg. tictacAPP.bat <br />
 So, next it will play just by a click <br />
 ## Note:
 If your computer gives python is not recognized as an internal or external command<br /> 
 than put python in envirnoment variable of your computer<br />
 by going in properties of MyComputer.<br />
  
### Try it and Enjoy :)
